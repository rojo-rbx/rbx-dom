Change:
  LuaSourceContainer:
    # ScriptGuid is randomly generated everytime a script is saved from Studio
    # which means that its default would change every time a database was
    # generated. To get around this, we need to override the default. Roblox
    # generates a new ScriptGuid if the one in a file is an empty string, so
    # setting the default to be an empty string is a reasonable default. 
    ScriptGuid:
      DefaultValue:
        String: ""
