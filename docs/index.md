# rbx-dom
This is the home for rbx-dom, a collection of libraries for working with the Roblox DOM including serialization, deserialization, and processing of reflection information.

## Unofficial Specifications
We maintain high quality documentation for Roblox's formats. This documentation is sourced entirely from the community and contains lessons learned from implementing these formats as part of rbx-dom.

* [Attributes Format](attributes.md)
* [Binary Model Format](binary.md)
* [DOM Data Model](dom.md) (stub)
* [XML Model Format](xml.md)

## Maintenance

Due to Roblox's rapid release cycle, maintenance of rbx-dom is an ongoing process. To ease the maintenance of rbx-dom both now and in the future, we maintain a few guides on how to perform basic maintenance on rbx-dom for contributors:

* [How to Fix a New Property Added by Roblox](patching-database.md)
* [Compatibility Concerns](compatibility.md)
