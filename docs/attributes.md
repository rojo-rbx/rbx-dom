# Roblox Attributes Binary Format

This document describes the Attribute binary format. In this format there is no field for Version, so it is assumed that any future changes will be additions to the existing format or a new format entirely.

## Document Conventions

This document assumes a basic understanding of Rust's convention for numeric types. For example: 

- `u32` is an unsigned 32-bit integer
- `f32` is a 32-bit floating point

All numeric types are little endian and signed integers are stored using two's complement. All floats are stored according to the IEEE-754 standard.

Unless otherwise noted, all structs in this document are assumed to be stored with their components in the sequence listed without any modification. That is, if a struct is listed as being composed of an `i32` and an `f32`, it can be assumed that it is stored as an `i32` followed by an `f32`.

## File Structure

Unlike the [normal binary format](binary.md), the attribute format is not chunk based. Instead, it follows a basic name-type-value sequence.

The exception to this is the beginning of the blob, which indicates how many attributes are stored in the blob.

The first 4 bytes of the blob are a `u32` which indicates how many attributes there are in the blob (the `Length`). Following that, there are `Length` attributes in the layout:

| Field Name | Format            | Value                                                   |
|:-----------|:------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| Name       | [String](#string) | The name of this attribute                              |
| Type       | `u8`              | The [data type](#data-types) of this attribute          |
| Value      | Variant           | A value whose type and layout is determined by **Type** |

## Data Types

For every data type that attributes can be, there's a corresponding value of `Type` that's used to indicate an attribute is of that type. Despite similiarities to the binary file format, these are not transferable between the two (e.g. in the binary format, String is `0x01` but here it is `0x02`). The following are attribute types supported by Roblox Studio.

### String
**Type ID `0x02`**

The `String` type is stored as a length-prefixed sequence of bytes. The length is stored as a `u32`. Strings can contain binary data, and should be considered to be an array of `u8`s.

| Field Name | Format       | Value                                    |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Length     | `u32`        | The length of the string                 |
| Data       | Array(Bytes) | The actual bytes that make up the string |

### Bool
**Type ID `0x03`**

The `Bool` type is stored as a single byte. If the byte is `0x00`, the bool is `false`. If it is `0x01`, it is true.

It is worth noting that Roblox Studio will interpret any non-zero value as `true`.

### Float32
**Type ID `0x05`**

The `Float32` type is stored as a [single-precision float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format), also known as an `f32` or `single`, or sometimes even simply `float`.

This type is accepted by Roblox Studio but will not ever be generated by it.

### Float64
**Type ID `0x06`**

The `Float64` type is stored as a [double-precision float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format), also known as an `f64` or `double`.

### UDim
**Type ID `0x09`**

The `UDim` type is stored as a struct composed of a `f32` and an `i32`:

| Field Name | Format | Value                              |
|:-----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| Scale      | `f32`  | The `Scale` component of the UDim  |
| Offset     | `i32`  | The `Offset` component of the UDim |

As an example, the UDim `{123, 456}` would look like this: `00 00 f6 42 c8 01 00 00`.

### UDim2
**Type ID `0x0A`**

The `UDim2` type is stored as a struct composed of two `UDim`s, one for each axis:

| Field Name | Format           | Value                           |
|:-----------|:-----------------|:--------------------------------|
| X Scale    | [`UDim`](#udim)  | The `X` component of the UDim2  |
| X Offset   | [`UDim`](#udim)  | The `Y` component of the UDim2  |

An encoded UDim2 with the value `{1, 2, 3, 4}` would look like this: `00 00 80 3f 02 00 00 00 00 00 40 40 04 00 00 00`.

### BrickColor
**Type ID `0x0E`**

The `BrickColor` type is stored as a single `u32` indicating the `Number` property of the BrickColor.

### Color3
**Type ID `0x0F`**

The `Color3` type is stored as a set of three `f32`s:

| Field Name  | Format | Value                             |
|:------------|:-------|:----------------------------------|
| R           | `f32`  | The `R` component of the Color3   |
| G           | `f32`  | The `G` component of the Color3   |
| B           | `f32`  | The `B` component of the Color3   |

A Color3 with the RGB value `0, 102, 255` would look like this: `00 00 00 00 cd cc cc 3e 00 00 80 3f`.

### Vector2
**Type ID `0x10`**

The `Vector2` type is a struct composed of two `f32`s:

| Field Name | Format | Value                            |
|:-----------|:-------|:---------------------------------|
| X          | `f32`  | The `X` component of the Vector2 |
| Y          | `f32`  | The `Y` component of the Vector2 |

A Vector2 with the value `10, 20` looks like this: `00 00 20 41 00 00 a0 41`.

### Vector3
**Type ID `0x11`**

The `Vector3` type is a struct composed of three `f32`s:

| Field Name | Format | Value                            |
|:-----------|:-------|:---------------------------------|
| X          | `f32`  | The `X` component of the Vector2 |
| Y          | `f32`  | The `Y` component of the Vector2 |
| Z          | `f32`  | The `Z` component of the Vector2 |

A Vector3 with the value `10, 20, 30` looks like this: `00 00 20 41 00 00 a0 41 00 00 f0 41`.

### CFrame
**Type ID `0x14`**

The `CFrame` type is composed of a `Vector3`, a 1-byte rotation ID, and an optional rotation matrix:

| Field Name      | Format              | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Position        | `Vector3`           | The positional component of the `CFrame`.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Rotation ID     | `u8`                | An identifier representing axis-alignment of the rotation, determining whether the rotation matrix is present (see `Rotation matrix`). If the rotation *is* axis-aligned, this field is one of the values from the table below; otherwise, it is `00`. |
| Rotation matrix | `Optional<Matrix3>` | The rotational component of the `CFrame`, stored as a sequence of nine `f32`s. If Rotation ID is `00`, this field is the XVector, the YVector, and ZVector, in that order; otherwise, it is absent.                                                    |

A rotation is considered "axis-aligned" if it's in increments of 90 degrees around one or more axes. The following table shows the mapping between Rotation IDs and rotations (rotations are Euler angles in degrees, applied in the order `Y -> X -> Z`):

| ID   | Rotation       | ID   | Rotation       |
|:-----|:---------------|:-----|:---------------|
| `02` | (0, 0, 0)      | `14` | (0, 180, 0)    |
| `03` | (90, 0, 0)     | `15` | (-90, -180, 0) |
| `05` | (0, 180, 180)  | `17` | (0, 0, 180)    |
| `06` | (-90, 0, 0)    | `18` | (90, 180, 0)   |
| `07` | (0, 180, 90)   | `19` | (0, 0, -90)    |
| `09` | (0, 90, 90)    | `1b` | (0, -90, -90)  |
| `0a` | (0, 0, 90)     | `1c` | (0, -180, -90) |
| `0c` | (0, -90, 90)   | `1e` | (0, 90, -90)   |
| `0d` | (-90, -90, 0)  | `1f` | (90, 90, 0)    |
| `0e` | (0, -90, 0)    | `20` | (0, 90, 0)     |
| `10` | (90, -90, 0)   | `22` | (-90, 90, 0)   |
| `11` | (0, 90, 180)   | `23` | (0, -90, 180)  |

A `CFrame` with the value `CFrame.new(1, 2, 3) * CFrame.Angles(0, 45, 0)` looks like this when serialized: `00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 40 00 00 40 40 00 f3 04 35 3f 00 00 00 00 f3 04 35 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 f3 04 35 bf 00 00 00 00 f3 04 35 3f`.

Demonstrating the axis-aligned rotation matrix case, a `CFrame` with the value `CFrame.new(1, 2, 3)` looks like this: `00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 40 00 00 40 40 02`.

### EnumItem
**Type ID `0x15`**

The `EnumItem` type is composed of two parts: 

| Field Name | Format              | Value                                                  |
|:-----------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| Enum Name  | [`String`](#string) | The name of the [`Enum`][Enum_Type] of this `EnumItem` |
| Value      | `u32`               | The `Value` field of the `EnumItem`                    |

[Enum_Type]: https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Enum

### NumberSequence
**Type ID `0x17`**

The `NumberSequence` type is stored as a struct composed of a `u32` and an array of `NumberSequenceKeypoint`s:

| Field Name     | Format                        | Value                                   |
|:---------------|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Keypoint Count | `u32`                         | The number of keypoints in the sequence |
| Keypoints      | Array(NumberSequenceKeypoint) | The keypoints that make up the sequence |

A `NumberSequenceKeypoint` is stored as a struct composed of three `f32`s:

| Field Name | Format | Value                         |
|:-----------|:-------|:------------------------------|
| Envelope   | f32    | The envelope for the keypoint |
| Time       | f32    | The time for the keypoint     |
| Value      | f32    | The value of the keypoint     |

A NumberSequence with the keypoints `0, 0, 0`, `0.5, 1, 0`, and `1, 1, 0.5` would look like this: `03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 3f 00 00 80 3f 00 00 80 3f`

### ColorSequence
**Type ID `0x17`**
The `ColorSequence` type is stored as a struct composed of a `u32` and an array of `ColorSequenceKeypoint`s:

| Field Name     | Format                        | Value                                   |
|:---------------|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Keypoint Count | `u32`                         | The number of keypoints in the sequence |
| Keypoints      | Array(ColorSequenceKeypoint) | The keypoints that make up the sequence |

A `ColorSequenceKeypoint` is stored as a struct composed of three `f32`s:

| Field Name   | Format              | Value                         |
|:-------------|:--------------------|:------------------------------|
| Envelope\*   | f32                 | The envelope for the keypoint |
| Time         | f32                 | The time for the keypoint     |
| Value        | [`Color3`](#color3) | The value of the keypoint     |

\*ColorSequenceKeypoint has a field for Envelope despite not having one; it will always be `00 00 00 00`

A ColorSequence with the keypoints `0, RGB(255, 0, 0)`, `0.5, RGB(0, 255, 0)`, and `1, RGB(0, 0, 255)` would look like this: `03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3f`

### NumberRange
**Type ID `0x1B`**

The `NumberRange` type is a struct composed of two `f32`s:

| Field Name   | Format | Value                                  |
|:-------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------|
| Min          | `f32`  | The `Min` component of the NumberRange |
| Max          | `f32`  | The `Max` component of the NumberRange |

A NumberRange with the value `10, 20` would look like this: `00 00 a0 40 00 00 20 41`.

### Rect
**Type ID `0x1C`**

The `Rect` type is a struct composed of two `Vector2`s:

| Field Name | Format                | Value                             |
|:-----------|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Min        | [`Vector2`](#vector2) | The `Min` component of the `Rect` |
| Max        | [`Vector2`](#vector2) | The `Max` component of the `Rect` |

A Rect with the value `10, 20, 30, 40` would look like this: `00 00 20 41 00 00 a0 41 00 00 f0 41 00 00 20 42`.

### Font
**Type ID `0x21`**

The `Font` type is a struct composed of a `u16`, `u8` and two `String`s

| Field Name   | Format                  | Value                                  |
|:-------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| Weight       | `u16`                   | The weight of the font                 |
| Style        | `u8`                    | The style of the font                  |
| Family       | [`String`](#string)     | The font family content URI            |
| CachedFaceId | [`String`](#string)     | The cached content URI of the TTF file |

The `Weight` and `Style` values refer to the `FontWeight` and `FontStyle` enums respectively. They are stored as unsigned little-endian

The `CachedFaceId` field will always be present, but may be an empty string.

A regular `Source Sans Pro` font will be stored as `90 01 00 2C 00 00 00 72 62 78 61 73 73 65 74 3A 2F 2F 66 6F 6E 74 73 2F 66 61 6D 69 6C 69 65 73 2F 53 6F 75 72 63 65 53 61 6E 73 50 72 6F 2E 6A 73 6F 6E 2A 00 00 00 72 62 78 61 73 73 65 74 3A 2F 2F 66 6F 6E 74 73 2F 53 6F 75 72 63 65 53 61 6E 73 50 72 6F 2D 52 65 67 75 6C 61 72 2E 74 74 66`
