//! Referents are strange compared to other property types.
//!
//! Refs require extra information, which is why they aren't part of the
//! `XmlType`-implementing family of structs like other types. I think this is
//! a better approach than widening the values that `XmlType` accepts just for
//! this type.
//!
//! Specifically, deserializing refs needs access to a special list of
//! 'rewrites'. It's used as part of a second pass to make sure that refs
//! pointing to instances that we haven't reached yet work okay.
