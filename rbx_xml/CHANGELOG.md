* Breaking: upgraded to rbx_dom_weak 2.0
* Added support for the `Ray` type, used in the `RayValue` instance.
* Added support for the `Faces` type, used in the `Handles` instance.

## 0.11.4 (2019-12-18)

## 0.11.3 (2019-12-11)
* Empty BinaryStrings will now serialize without an empty CDATA tag ([#76](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/76)).

## 0.11.2 (2019-08-08)

## 0.11.1 (2019-08-01)
* Fixed decoding `BinaryString` values with arbitrary whitespace in them, including CRLF line endings.

## 0.11.0 (2019-07-12)

## 0.10.0 (2019-06-10)
* Added support for INF and NAN values in compound types like Vector2 ([#62](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/62))

* Fixed type conversion when serializing properties whose serialized type differs from its canonical type ([#56](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/56))
* Changed type conversion failures when serializing to elevate to serialization errors ([#58](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/58))

## 0.7.0 (2019-05-12)
* Breaking: changed API dramatically to make deserializing instances easier
	* Renamed deserialization APIs to be named like `from_reader`
	* Renamed serialization APIs to be named like `to_writer`
	* Added options to APIs
	* Made error types opaque
* Breaking: changed serialization to be reflection-driven, which improves content compatibility
* Fixed serializing empty `Content` properties ([#146](https://github.com/Roblox/rojo/issues/146))

	* `Int64` and `Float64` ([#15](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/15))
	* `Ref` and `PhysicalProperties`, no longer stubs!
* Rewrote lots of internals, which should improve whitespace handling ([#17](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/17), [#19](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/19))

## 0.5.0 (2019-03-13)

* Updated to `rbx_dom_weak` 1.0
* Fixed `ProtectedString` support, which was missing from the main deserializer loop
* Added support for `Content`, `UDim` and `UDim2` values
* Fixed `Ref` properties pointing to invalid IDs by changing them to always deserialize to `None` for now

## 0.3.0 (2019-02-14)
* Updated `rbx_tree` dependency to `rbx_dom_weak` 0.3.0
* Added support for `ProtectedString`, deserializing as String

	* Shape (serializes as `shape`)

## 0.1.0
* Initial release
* Deserialization does not produce instances
* Supports serializing `String` and `Bool` properties
